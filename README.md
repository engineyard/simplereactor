=============

This is a very simple, pure Ruby event based IO reactor. It was originally written for an article for the Engine Yard Blog in 2011, but was found to have some uses as a standalone gem. Use this when you need a simple, pure ruby event reactor for IO handling. The code is short. There are no external dependencies, and the intention is that it stays short and simple.
